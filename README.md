# Cyber Security Internship – Task 1
**Objective:** Scan local network for open ports to understand network exposure.

## Tools
- Kali Linux VM
- Nmap

## Steps Performed
1. Updated Kali packages.
2. Identified local IP range with `ip a` → 192.168.1.0/24.
3. Ran TCP SYN scan:
4. Saved results to `scan_results.txt`.

## Findings
- Devices detected: XX
- Common open ports: 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP)...
- Security risks: Unnecessary services may allow unauthorized access.

## Learning
- Network reconnaissance
- Port scanning basics
- Identifying potential attack surfaces
